# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Calculator program on Codecademy. It was how I was passing the integers into the method. I was using: "public int add(a, b): when I should have been "public int add(int a, int b)". From there I cleaned up the rest of the syntax errors, ran the project and went on and did the next quiz. Started working on Arrays before realizing that there is another project for me to do so I will need to go back and do that tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Because I couldn't figure it out I ended up using the tried and true Google method to get the answer to my struggles with the calculator program. The thing I saw was like I thought, most people suggested to cut the code into small bite sized chunks and clear out the errors, make it work and move to the next chunk. It is good and vindicating to know that I have the right idea on something.

I also started reading a Java book "Java in 24 hours" last night. got through the first hour in no time flat, since it mostly tells me why I should code, something I know already. I also went through the section on setting up and preparing to code. The book suggests netbeans which I couldn't get to work when I tried it in the past, but I am fine using Eclipse, so I don't suspect that I will have trouble moving forward. I'll probably attack the second chapter after I finish the tutorials on codecademy since there isn't much left already. When I looked at the end of my work today I was already 66% through the tutorial. I'll probably be done within the week at the rate I'm going.

### Day 5: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Flew through the remainder of the tutorial that i was working on in codecademy this morning. Literally took me like 5 minutes. From there I went on to the freeform project, a calculator that adds, subracts, multiplies, divides, and provides remainders of 2 values passed in within the program. Followed their directions and it doesn't work. I think I cleaned up most if not all the syntax stuff but it still isn't working. I think it has something to do with how I'm passing the variables back and forth.  

**Thoughts:** Kind of frustrated with how codecademy has me building this calculator. It isn't how I would do it. I'd build the main method and the "add" method. Once I get those 2 working, I'd add in "subtract" and so on and so forth, building it as if it was a set of blocks. Instead, following their directions you build everything and have to make it all work at once. Seems like a horrible way to build anything as you don't always know which block you have broken stuff in. I think when I go back to this again (likely later today because it is bugging me), I will go back and do it my way. I hope I get better results than banging my head against the wall. First though, I need to read about how and where to create variables. I bet I am doing it wrong because right now I am creating the 2 same variables over and over in each of the methods to do the math. This seems like a dumb way to do it, and I bet is part of my problem.

### Day 4: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Quickly built out an interest calculator for a car loan on codecademy this morning. It didn't take long and I learned that while codecademy will take the input class in, it won't allow you to use it in their online IDE. I had wanted to take in the values for loan, interest rate, term, etc. but had to just go with setting the variables in the code. Then went on to begin learning about object oriented programming. 

**Thoughts:** I took yesterday off because it was Easter. I figure it won't kill me to take holidays off. This is my adventure, I can make the rules, right? The code around the loan calculator was easy enough. I didn't really forget anything I had learned that I needed to use, though I was disappointed that I wanted to grow it beyond the constraints of the current system. I will have to copy it over into eclipse later and mess around with accepting inputs. I really think that would be better.

Object oriented programming is completely foreign to me. When I was learning Pascal and C back in the early 90's I don't remember anyone ever talking about objects at all. It seems sort of like functions in C, but not exactly. I'll likely need to do more research and reading about it once I have a better handle on what I'm doing today.

### Day 3: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went back and read some more of the tutorialspoint pages, which do not line up exactly with the codecademy tutorial. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. I did go through the if/else statements and case stsatemetns in the tutorial which lined up with the codecademy stuff, but then it went into classes for number, character and strings. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't a clue what classes mean right now for number, character an string. I'm sure someday that will come clear. Also trying to focus on an hour of coding while everyone is in the house and doing stuff is a challenge. I will need to begin to time myself better to when it is quiet in the house so I can spend better time focusing.

### Day 2: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to use the tutorialspoint tutorial, but quickly realized that there were examples but no projects involved. Switched to the Codecademy Java tutorial for some hands on work. Completed Introduction to Java (20% of total class) including Math freeform project.

**Thoughts:** I know that I need to do some hands on experience to really drive home this language (and anything for that matter), so I needed to switch to something that would give me that experience. My plan for the moment is to go through the entire Java tutorials on Codecademy and then search out projects online and just start building them. I also picked up a book Java in 24 hours that has projects at the end of the chapter. I may just start building those as well to reinforce.

### Day 1: March 29, 2018
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with Netbeans for a bit before reading down far enough to see that it won't work with JDK9, so downloaded Eclipse as my IDE. Then proceeded to do their "HelloWorld" tutorial with no trouble.

**Thoughts:** I guess I really have been picking something up in all the reading I have done off and on of late. That isn't really a bad thing I suppose. I can't wait to do something a bit more interesting than the standard hello world coding that is required of every new coder.
