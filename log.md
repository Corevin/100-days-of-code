# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went back and read some more of the tutorialspoint pages, which do not line up exactly with the codecademy tutorial. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. I did go through the if/else statements and case stsatemetns in the tutorial which lined up with the codecademy stuff, but then it went into classes for number, character and strings. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't a clue what classes mean right now for number, character an string. I'm sure someday that will come clear. Also trying to focus on an hour of coding while everyone is in the house and doing stuff is a challenge. I will need to begin to time myself better to when it is quiet in the house so I can spend better time focusing.

### Day 2: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to use the tutorialspoint tutorial, but quickly realized that there were examples but no projects involved. Switched to the Codecademy Java tutorial for some hands on work. Completed Introduction to Java (20% of total class) including Math freeform project.

**Thoughts:** I know that I need to do some hands on experience to really drive home this language (and anything for that matter), so I needed to switch to something that would give me that experience. My plan for the moment is to go through the entire Java tutorials on Codecademy and then search out projects online and just start building them. I also picked up a book Java in 24 hours that has projects at the end of the chapter. I may just start building those as well to reinforce.

### Day 1: March 29, 2018
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with Netbeans for a bit before reading down far enough to see that it won't work with JDK9, so downloaded Eclipse as my IDE. Then proceeded to do their "HelloWorld" tutorial with no trouble.

**Thoughts:** I guess I really have been picking something up in all the reading I have done off and on of late. That isn't really a bad thing I suppose. I can't wait to do something a bit more interesting than the standard hello world coding that is required of every new coder.
