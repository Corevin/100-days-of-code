**Today's Progress**: Struggled with Netbeans for a bit before reading down far enough to see that it won't work with JDK9, so downloaded Eclipse as my IDE. Then proceeded to do their "HelloWorld" tutorial with no trouble.

**Thoughts:** I guess I really have been picking something up in all the reading I have done off and on of late. That isn't really a bad thing I suppose. I can't wait to do something a bit more interesting than the standard hello world coding that is required of every new coder.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
