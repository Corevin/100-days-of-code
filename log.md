# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the chapter 2 of Think Java exercises. Built a program that takes the hours, minutes, and seconds variables (still need to look up how to accept inputs), and output them in a bunch of different ways as well as do a bunch of math functions on them to and report out the results.

**Thoughts:** The exercises are a bit simple for me, but I consider it a good review. If nothing else it is forcing me to actually practice the syntax for Java, which is good, it will help me remember and make sure that I am not missing anything. Also helps to make sure I have committed it to memory. Repitition = good when it comes to coding, right? 

I ended up asking in Slack about Arrays. I really don't like not understanding them. I got a couple of responses but, not really a huge help. One response was an article on Arrays in general; that was interesting but not quite what I was looking for. The other response was a request for the code I'd written. Sadly, the code I've written doesn't work and I don't think even I have enough there to share yet. I'll have to figure out what I'm going to do next.

### Day 10: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked with excercises on variables, assignment and printing them out in different formats. Played around with print vs printlns. Reached out to the folks in the 100 days of code Slack to see if anyone had suggestions as Arrays have 100% mystified me.

**Thoughts:** So instead of being frustrated any longer, I decided to switch it up. A while back I purchased a bunch of Java books in a humble bundel lot and so I started reading one of those last night. I am in chapter 2 at this point of "Think Java" by Allen B. Downey and Chris Mayfield. It is a lot of review thus far, but I don't think it is a bad thing really. I am going to use it to review what i already know, and from there hopefully build up some. 

I am currently saving the work I  am doing on my harddrive. I want to add it here to my 100 days of code fork, but haven't figured out how. I will have to take a look into it later today and see if I can figure it out.

### Day 9: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued banging my head against Java Arrays. Still working on the student grade calculator and failing miserably.

**Thoughts:** This is becoming rather frustrating. First on both Saturday and Sunday I attempted to do more work on coding, but on both days every time I started to do any work on it someone interrupted me and started talking to me. Made it impossible to even move forward the slightest bit. Today I dug back in and have spent an hour now hitting my head against the code. Nothing seems to work, all of the things I thought I knew, I clearly do not because I get compiler errors when trying to do them. I've gone back to Google in hopes of trying to figure this out as the codecademy lessons clarly aren't ringing true for me somehow. using: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/ next.

### Day 8: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a simple student grade calculator, needed to spend more time learning about arrays as nothing I did worked.

**Thoughts:** I am seriously struggling now. I didn't have a ton of time today to dig too deep in the code, but it was quickly made aware to me that I didn't have the required skills to do the project. I will need ot focus on it more tomorrow.

### Day 7: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple "Droid" that kept track of battery life while it hovered and recharged the battery. Went on and did some quick lessons on ArrayList, For Loops, For Each loops. Took a look at HackerEarth and did the first 3 challenges with no problem. Stuck on the 4th challenge which is to report out the square of an array. They give the array code and I just need to do the math and print it out. Not sure what I'm missing. Will have to look more at it. On Codecademy, I am 80% done with their only Java tutorial, just 2 

**Thoughts:** On Codecademy, I am 80% done with their only Java tutorial, just 2 freeform"ish" projects to go. I really am not feeling like I am ready to go beyond. I have seen some basics of stuff, but it doesn't really feel like I have put it all together at all. I seriously need to find more stuff to build for practice. 

On another note, I can't believe it has been a week already. That is a good start for me I would say, I wouldn't have thought at the beginning of this that I even would have gotten through the first week of this coding challenge. Let's see how far I get!

### Day 6: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Calculator program on Codecademy. It was how I was passing the integers into the method. I was using: "public int add(a, b): when I should have been "public int add(int a, int b)". From there I cleaned up the rest of the syntax errors, ran the project and went on and did the next quiz. Started working on Arrays before realizing that there is another project for me to do so I will need to go back and do that tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Because I couldn't figure it out I ended up using the tried and true Google method to get the answer to my struggles with the calculator program. The thing I saw was like I thought, most people suggested to cut the code into small bite sized chunks and clear out the errors, make it work and move to the next chunk. It is good and vindicating to know that I have the right idea on something.

I also started reading a Java book "Java in 24 hours" last night. got through the first hour in no time flat, since it mostly tells me why I should code, something I know already. I also went through the section on setting up and preparing to code. The book suggests netbeans which I couldn't get to work when I tried it in the past, but I am fine using Eclipse, so I don't suspect that I will have trouble moving forward. I'll probably attack the second chapter after I finish the tutorials on codecademy since there isn't much left already. When I looked at the end of my work today I was already 66% through the tutorial. I'll probably be done within the week at the rate I'm going.

### Day 5: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Flew through the remainder of the tutorial that i was working on in codecademy this morning. Literally took me like 5 minutes. From there I went on to the freeform project, a calculator that adds, subracts, multiplies, divides, and provides remainders of 2 values passed in within the program. Followed their directions and it doesn't work. I think I cleaned up most if not all the syntax stuff but it still isn't working. I think it has something to do with how I'm passing the variables back and forth.  

**Thoughts:** Kind of frustrated with how codecademy has me building this calculator. It isn't how I would do it. I'd build the main method and the "add" method. Once I get those 2 working, I'd add in "subtract" and so on and so forth, building it as if it was a set of blocks. Instead, following their directions you build everything and have to make it all work at once. Seems like a horrible way to build anything as you don't always know which block you have broken stuff in. I think when I go back to this again (likely later today because it is bugging me), I will go back and do it my way. I hope I get better results than banging my head against the wall. First though, I need to read about how and where to create variables. I bet I am doing it wrong because right now I am creating the 2 same variables over and over in each of the methods to do the math. This seems like a dumb way to do it, and I bet is part of my problem.

### Day 4: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Quickly built out an interest calculator for a car loan on codecademy this morning. It didn't take long and I learned that while codecademy will take the input class in, it won't allow you to use it in their online IDE. I had wanted to take in the values for loan, interest rate, term, etc. but had to just go with setting the variables in the code. Then went on to begin learning about object oriented programming. 

**Thoughts:** I took yesterday off because it was Easter. I figure it won't kill me to take holidays off. This is my adventure, I can make the rules, right? The code around the loan calculator was easy enough. I didn't really forget anything I had learned that I needed to use, though I was disappointed that I wanted to grow it beyond the constraints of the current system. I will have to copy it over into eclipse later and mess around with accepting inputs. I really think that would be better.

Object oriented programming is completely foreign to me. When I was learning Pascal and C back in the early 90's I don't remember anyone ever talking about objects at all. It seems sort of like functions in C, but not exactly. I'll likely need to do more research and reading about it once I have a better handle on what I'm doing today.

### Day 3: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went back and read some more of the tutorialspoint pages, which do not line up exactly with the codecademy tutorial. I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. I did go through the if/else statements and case stsatemetns in the tutorial which lined up with the codecademy stuff, but then it went into classes for number, character and strings. 

**Thoughts:** I haven't a clue what classes mean right now for number, character an string. I'm sure someday that will come clear. Also trying to focus on an hour of coding while everyone is in the house and doing stuff is a challenge. I will need to begin to time myself better to when it is quiet in the house so I can spend better time focusing.

### Day 2: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued to use the tutorialspoint tutorial, but quickly realized that there were examples but no projects involved. Switched to the Codecademy Java tutorial for some hands on work. Completed Introduction to Java (20% of total class) including Math freeform project.

**Thoughts:** I know that I need to do some hands on experience to really drive home this language (and anything for that matter), so I needed to switch to something that would give me that experience. My plan for the moment is to go through the entire Java tutorials on Codecademy and then search out projects online and just start building them. I also picked up a book Java in 24 hours that has projects at the end of the chapter. I may just start building those as well to reinforce.

### Day 1: March 29, 2018
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with Netbeans for a bit before reading down far enough to see that it won't work with JDK9, so downloaded Eclipse as my IDE. Then proceeded to do their "HelloWorld" tutorial with no trouble.

**Thoughts:** I guess I really have been picking something up in all the reading I have done off and on of late. That isn't really a bad thing I suppose. I can't wait to do something a bit more interesting than the standard hello world coding that is required of every new coder.
